# KanTan

KanTan is a tool designed to make kanji lookup easier by combining kanji lookup and word lookup into one. KanTan allows you to
specify a pattern for a word using the radicals that you recognize, and find all the words that match that pattern.

A live version can be found [here](http://itayperl.github.io/kantan/ui).
